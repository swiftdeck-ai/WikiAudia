Chronology

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:14,736
The start of the war in Europe is generally held to be 1 September 1939, beginning with the German invasion of Poland; the United Kingdom and France declared war on Germany two days later

4
00:00:14,736 --> 00:00:30,360
The dates for the beginning of war in the Pacific include the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War on 7 July 1937, or even the Japanese invasion of Manchuria on 19 September 1931.Others follow the British historian A.J.P

7
00:00:41,832 --> 00:00:50,208
Other starting dates sometimes used for World War II include the Italian invasion of Abyssinia on 3 October 1935

8
00:00:50,208 --> 00:01:05,832
The British historian Antony Beevor views the beginning of World War II as the Battles of Khalkhin Gol fought between Japan and the forces of Mongolia and the Soviet Union from May to September 1939.The exact date of the war's end is also not universally agreed upon

9
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:20,184
It was generally accepted at the time that the war ended with the armistice of 14 August 1945 (V-J Day), rather than the formal surrender of Japan, which was on 2 September 1945 that officially ended the war in Asia

10
00:01:20,184 --> 00:01:23,808
A peace treaty with Japan was signed in 1951

11
00:01:23,808 --> 00:01:33,600
A treaty regarding Germany's future allowed the reunification of East and West Germany to take place in 1990 and resolved most post-World War II issues

12
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,448
No formal peace treaty between Japan and the Soviet Union was ever signed.

Background

14
00:01:40,448 --> 00:01:42,448
Europe

15
00:01:42,448 --> 00:01:58,576
World War I had radically altered the political European map, with the defeat of the Central Powers—including Austria-Hungary, Germany, Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire—and the 1917 Bolshevik seizure of power in Russia, which eventually led to the founding of the Soviet Union

16
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:18,952
Meanwhile, the victorious Allies of World War I, such as France, Belgium, Italy, Romania, and Greece, gained territory, and new nation-states were created out of the collapse of Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman and Russian Empires.

To prevent a future world war, the League of Nations was created during the 1919 Paris Peace Conference

17
00:02:18,952 --> 00:02:39,640
The organisation's primary goals were to prevent armed conflict through collective security, military and naval disarmament, and settling international disputes through peaceful negotiations and arbitration.
Despite strong pacifist sentiment after World War I, its aftermath still caused irredentist and revanchist nationalism in several European states

18
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:48,592
These sentiments were especially marked in Germany because of the significant territorial, colonial, and financial losses incurred by the Treaty of Versailles

19
00:02:48,592 --> 00:03:12,880
Under the treaty, Germany lost around 13 percent of its home territory and all its overseas possessions, while German annexation of other states was prohibited, reparations were imposed, and limits were placed on the size and capability of the country's armed forces.The German Empire was dissolved in the German Revolution of 1918–1919, and a democratic government, later known as the Weimar Republic, was created

20
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:19,864
The interwar period saw strife between supporters of the new republic and hardline opponents on both the right and left

21
00:03:19,864 --> 00:03:34,192
Italy, as an Entente ally, had made some post-war territorial gains; however, Italian nationalists were angered that the promises made by the United Kingdom and France to secure Italian entrance into the war were not fulfilled in the peace settlement

22
00:03:34,192 --> 00:04:07,672
From 1922 to 1925, the Fascist movement led by Benito Mussolini seized power in Italy with a nationalist, totalitarian, and class collaborationist agenda that abolished representative democracy, repressed socialist, left-wing and liberal forces, and pursued an aggressive expansionist foreign policy aimed at making Italy a world power, promising the creation of a "New Roman Empire".

Adolf Hitler, after an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the German government in 1923, eventually became the Chancellor of Germany in 1933

23
00:04:07,672 --> 00:04:16,072
He abolished democracy, espousing a radical, racially motivated revision of the world order, and soon began a massive rearmament campaign

24
00:04:16,072 --> 00:04:24,136
Meanwhile, France, to secure its alliance, allowed Italy a free hand in Ethiopia, which Italy desired as a colonial possession

25
00:04:24,136 --> 00:04:53,176
The situation was aggravated in early 1935 when the Territory of the Saar Basin was legally reunited with Germany and Hitler repudiated the Treaty of Versailles, accelerated his rearmament programme, and introduced conscription.The United Kingdom, France and Italy formed the Stresa Front in April 1935 in order to contain Germany, a key step towards military globalisation; however, that June, the United Kingdom made an independent naval agreement with Germany, easing prior restrictions
